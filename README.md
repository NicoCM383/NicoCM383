Machine Learning Engineer specializing in AI, computer vision, and automation. Expert in Python, SQL, NumPy/Pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch, OpenCV, ROS, Docker, FastAPI, Streamlit, and Redis; additional depth in drones (Pixhawk, MAVLink, Raspberry Pi). Former AI Developer at DL Consultores, leading autonomous drone safety systems, including the Sentinel for Mining project presented at COPAIPA. Currently researching high-performance evolutionary computing and applied data analysis at UCASAL; Computer Science Engineering degree in progress. Strong fit for ML engineering and AI-driven product development.

* **I’m interested in machine learning engineering, computer vision, LLMs (prompting, fine-tuning, RAG), autonomous systems, and AI-driven product development (plus robotics & drones)**.

- 🌱 I’m currently deepening:

  - PyTorch/TensorFlow & scikit-learn (CV pipelines)

  - LLMs: prompt engineering, lightweight fine-tuning (LoRA), retrieval-augmented generation

  - ROS / Pixhawk / MAVLink (autonomy)

  - Evolutionary computing & high-performance optimization

  - MLOps with Docker, FastAPI, Streamlit

- 👯 I’m open to collaborating on open-source ML/CV, LLM applications, robotics, and drone autonomy projects.

- ✔ Ask me about Python/SQL, computer vision, LLMs/RAG, ROS, and applied AI for real-world systems.

- Outside tech, 📖 I enjoy reading, 🖌️ painting & sketching, 🎵 music, and 🌴 the outdoors.
